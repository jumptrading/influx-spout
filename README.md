# influx-spout [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jumptrading/influx-spout.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jumptrading/influx-spout) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/jumptrading/influx-spout)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/jumptrading/influx-spout)

## Overview

influx-spout is an open source messaging system that routes and processes
[InfluxDB line protocol] metrics from agents (for example [Telegraf]) to
processing and storage backends ([InfluxDB], [Kapacitor] etc.).

Key features:

- Proven ability to handle high volumes of data (>500k points per second)
  in a production environment
- Horizontal scalability
  * Multithreaded data processing within components
  * Components can be distributed on multiple servers or a fleet of containers
- Ability to add and remove endpoints without disrupting existing data flows
- Fine-grained, regexp-based control over routing of metrics data to specific
  backends
- Sanity checking of the data stream that prevents corrupt metrics data from
  reaching backends
- Batching of outgoing data to larger chunks, making it easier for backends
  to handle high-volume dataflows
- Leverages the high-performance [NATS] messaging system

```

All the influx-spout components may be run on a single host or may be
spread across multiple hosts depending on scaling and operational
requirements.

## Building

Ensure the `GOPATH` environment is properly exported and simply run
`make` to build influx-spout. We recommend building with Go 1.9+.


## Configuration

influx-spout is a single binary which will run as any of the component
modes, depending on the configuration provided. The binary takes a
single mandatory positional argument which is the path to the [TOML]
configuration file to use:

```
influx-spout [/path/to/config.toml]
```

During startup, `/etc/influx-spout.toml` is parsed first, if it exists. The
configuration specified in the file with provided on the command line overrides
any configuration in `/etc/influx-spout.toml`. This allows configuration common
to different influx-spout components to be shared.

[TOML]: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

### Byte Sizes

All configuration options that define a bytes size are specified using a
string and contain an optional unit suffix. These examples are all
valid ways to express the same byte size: `"2097152"`, `"2048KB"`, `"2MB"`,
`"2M"` (single char), `"2mb"` (lower case), `"2 MB"` (space before unit).

### Time Durations

All configuration options that define a time duration are specified
using a string and should use a unit suffix. These examples are all
valid ways to express the same duration: `"7200s"`, `"120m"`,
`"2h"`. Valid suffixes are "ns", "us", "ms", "s", "m" and "h".


## Modes

This section documents the various influx-spout component modes and
how to configure them.

### Listener

The listener is responsible for receiving InfluxDB line protocol measurements
on a UDP port, batching them and sending them on to a single NATS subject. In
typical deployments, a single listener will exist but it is possible to run
multiple listeners.

The supported configuration options for the listener mode follow. Defaults are
shown.


```toml
mode = "listener"  # Required

# UDP port to listen on.
port = 10001

# Address of NATS server.
nats_address = "nats://localhost:4222"

# Subject to publish received measurements on. This must be a list with one item.
nats_subject = ["influx-spout"]

# The maximum number of packets to receive before forwarding batched messages
# to the NATS server. Increasing this number reduces NATS communication overhead
# but increases latency.
batch_max_count = 10

# The maximum amount of time the listener will hold on to batched
# lines. If this age is reached, the batch is written to NATS.
batch_max_age = "5m"

# The maximum size that the listener should send at once to NATS.
# This should be no bigger than the NATS server's max_payload setting (which
# defaults to 1 MB).
batch_max_size = "1MB"

# Maximum UDP socket receive buffer size. A higher value this increases the
# peak inbound traffic the listener can handle at the cost of higher memory
# consumption.
#
# The default value is good for low to medium loads but should be increased to
# support higher receive rates.
read_buffer_size = "4MB"

# The listener will publish its own metrics to this NATS subject (for consumption
# by the monitor).
nats_subject_monitor = "influx-spout-monitor"

# The listener will publish its internal metrics to the monitor component at
# this interval.
stats_interval = "3s"

# The listener will serve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes on this port
# at /healthz and /readyz. Set to 0 (the default) to disable probes support.
probe_port = 0

# The listener will serve Go pprof requests at this port. Set to 0 (the
# default) to disable pprof support.
pprof_port = 0
```

The listener will batch up messages until one of the limits defined by the
`batch_max_count`, `batch_max_size` or `batch_max_age` options is reached.


### HTTP Listener

The HTTP listener is like the UDP listener (above) except that it receives
measurements sent using HTTP request bodies to a `/write` endpoint on the
configured port.

The supported configuration options for the HTTP listener mode follow. Defaults
are shown.

```toml
mode = "listener_http"  # Required

# TCP port to server a HTTP server on. A single "/write" endpoint is available here.
port = 13337

# Address of NATS server.
nats_address = "nats://localhost:4222"

# Subject to publish received measurements on. This must be a list with one item.
nats_subject = ["influx-spout"]

# The maximum number of inbound HTTP writes to batch before forwarding to the
# NATS server. Increasing this number reduces NATS communication overhead but
# increases latency.
batch_max_count = 10

# The maximum amount of time the listener will hold on to batched
# lines. If this age is reached, the batch is written to NATS.
batch_max_age = "5m"

# The maximum size that the listener should send at once to NATS.
# This should be no bigger than the NATS server's max_payload setting (which
# defaults to 1 MB).
batch_max_size = "1MB"

# The HTTP listener will publish its own metrics to this NATS subject (for
# consumption by the monitor).
nats_subject_monitor = "influx-spout-monitor"

# The HTTP listener will publish its internal metrics to the monitor component
# at this interval.
stats_interval = "3s"

# The HTTP listener will serve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes on this
# port at /healthz and /readyz. Set to 0 (the default) to disable probes support.
probe_port = 0

# The HTTP listener will serve Go pprof requests at this port. Set to 0 (the
# default) to disable pprof support.
pprof_port = 0
```


The HTTP listener will batch up messages until one of the limits defined by the
`batch_max_count`, `batch_max_size` or `batch_max_age` options is reached.

### Filter

The filter is responsible for filtering measurements published to NATS
by the listener, and forwarding them on to other NATS
subjects. Multiple filters may be run to distribute the filtering
workload across machines.

The supported configuration options for the filter mode follow. Defaults are
shown.

```toml
mode = "filter"  # Required

# Address of NATS server.
nats_address = "nats://localhost:4222"

# Subject to receive measurements from (presumably from the listener).
# This must be a list with one item.
nats_subject = ["influx-spout"]

# Measurements which do not match any rule (below) are sent to this NATS subject.
nats_subject_junkyard = "influx-spout-junk"

# The filter will publish its own metrics to this NATS subject (for consumption
# by the monitor).
nats_subject_monitor = "influx-spout-monitor"

# The maximum size that the pending buffer for the NATS subject that the filter
# is reading from may become. Measurements will be dropped if this limit is reached.
nats_max_pending_size = "200MB"

# The number of filter workers to spawn.
workers = 8

# The filter will publish its internal metrics to the monitor component at this
# interval.
stats_interval = "3s"

# The filter will serve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes on this port at
# /healthz and /readyz. Set to 0 (the default) to disable probes support.
probe_port = 0

# The filter will serve Go pprof requests at this port. Set to 0 (the default)
# to disable pprof support.
pprof_port = 0

# Incoming metrics with timestamps ± this value from the current time will be
# rejected. Metrics with timestamps that are significantly different from previously
# written timestamps negatively impact InfluxDB performance.
max_time_delta = "10m"

# At least one rule should be defined. Rules are defined using TOML's table
# syntax. The following examples show each rule type.

[[rule]]
# "basic" rules match a measurement name exactly.
type = "basic"

# For basic rules, "match" specifies an exact measurement name.
match = "cgroup"

# Measurements matching the rule are forwarded to this subject.
subject = "measurement.cgroup"

[[rule]]
# "tags" rules match measurement tags exactly.
type = "tags"

# Each item in "tags" specifies a tag key and value pair. All tags specified
# must be present for the line to match the rule.
tags = [
  ["key1", "value1"],
  ["key2", "value2"],
]

# As above.
subject = "somewhere"

[[rule]]
# "regex" rules apply a regular expression to full measurement lines.
# Note: regex rules are significantly slower than basic and tags rules. Use
# with care.
type = "regex"

# For regex rules, "match" specifies regular expression pattern to apply.
match = "host=web.+,"

# As above.
subject = "hosts.web"


[[rule]]
# "negregex" rules apply a regular expression to full measurement lines and
# match measurements which *don't* match the regular expression.
# Note: negregex rules are significantly slower than basic rules. Use with care.
type = "negregex"

# For negregex rules, "match" specifies regular expression pattern to apply.
match = "host=web.+,"

# As above.
subject = "not-web"
```

Ordering of rules in the configuration is important. Only the first rule that
matches a given measurement is applied.


### Downsampler

The downsampler reads measurements from one or more NATS subjects,
accumlates them and emits sampled values at a configured sampling
period. This is useful for generating long term archive feeds of
measurements.

Integer and float fields are averaged over each sampling period. For
string and boolean fields, the latest value for each sampling interval
is emitted.

The input subjects to a downsampler are intended to be the outputs
from the filter.

The downsampler sends its output to NATS subjects that match the input
subjects with a suffix as configured by `downsample_suffix` (default
is `-archive`). For example, averaged measurements for an input
subject of `monitoring` would be output by the downsampler to a
NATS subject named `monitoring-archive`.

Writers should be configured to consume the downsampler output
subjects and write them to an InfluxDB instance for storage.

```toml
mode = "downsampler"  # Required

# Address of NATS server.
nats_address = "nats://localhost:4222"

# Subjects to accumulate measurements from (these should be filter outputs).
nats_subject = ["influx-spout"]

# The period to sample measurements over. Averaged measurements will be
# emitted for each period at this interval.
downsample_period = "1m"

# This suffix will be added to each input NATS subject name to form the
# output subject names.
downsample_suffix = "-archive"

# The maximum size that the pending buffer for the NATS subject that the
# downsampler is reading from may become. Measurements will be dropped if
# this limit is reached.
nats_max_pending_size = "200MB"

# The downsampler will publish its own metrics to this NATS subject (for
# consumption by the monitor).
nats_subject_monitor = "influx-spout-monitor"

# The downsampler will publish its internal metrics to the monitor component at
# this interval.
stats_interval = "3s"

# The downsampler will serve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes on this
# port at /healthz and /readyz. Set to 0 (the default) to disable probes support.
probe_port = 0
```


### Writer

A writer is responsible for reading measurements from one or more NATS subjects,
optionally filtering them and then writing matching them to an InfluxDB
instances. A writer should be run for each InfluxDB backend that influx-spout
should send measurements to.

The supported configuration options for the writer mode follow. Defaults are
shown.

```toml
mode = "writer"  # Required

# Address of NATS server.
nats_address = "nats://localhost:4222"

# The NATS subjects to receive measurements from.
nats_subject = ["influx-spout"]

# Address of the InfluxDB instance to write to.
influxdb_address = "localhost"

# Protocol of the InfluxDB instance to write to (http/https).
influxdb_protocol = "http"

# TCP port where the InfluxDB backend can be found.
influxdb_port = 8086

# The InfluxDB database name to write to. The default value is unlikely to be
# useful. Please set to an appropriate value.
influxdb_dbname = "influx-spout-junk"

# The maximum number of message chunks to collect before a write to InfluxDB
# will be triggered. Increasing this number reduces communication overhead
# with InfluxDB but increases latency.
batch_max_count = 10

# The maximum amount of message data a writer worker may collect. If this limit
# is reached, a write to InfluxDB is performed.
#
# This should be no larger than the max-body-size option configured for the
# InfluxDB being written to. The default max-body-size value is 25MB.
batch_max_size = "10MB"

# The maximum amount of time a writer worker is allowed to hold on to collected
# data. If this limit is reached, a write to InfluxDB is performed.
batch_max_age = "5m"

# The number of writer workers to spawn.
workers = 8

# The maximum amount of time a writer will wait for an InfluxDB write to
# complete. Writes which time out will be dropped.
write_timeout = "30s"

# The maximum number of batches that failed to write to InfluxDB to track for
# retry at any given time. The oldest batch being kept for retry will be
# discarded if necessary to keep the set of batches being retried within this
# limit. Set to 0 to disable write retries.
writer_retry_batches = 1

# The amount of time between InfluxDB write retry attempts.
writer_retry_interval = "10s"

# The maximum amount of time to keep retrying a given batch.
writer_retry_timeout = "1m"

# The maximum size that the pending buffer for the NATS subject that the filter
# is reading from may become. Measurements will be dropped if this limit is reached.
nats_max_pending_size = "200MB"

# The writer will publish its own metrics to this NATS subject (for consumption
# by the monitor).
nats_subject_monitor = "influx-spout-monitor"

# The writer will publish its internal metrics to the monitor component at this
# interval.
stats_interval = "3s"

# The writer will serve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes on this port at
# /healthz and /readyz. Set to 0 (the default) to disable probes support.
probe_port = 0

# The writer will serve Go pprof requests at this port. Set to 0 (the default)
# to disable pprof support.
pprof_port = 0

# Writers can optionally include filter rules. When filter rules are configured,
# measurements which don't match a rule will be dropped by the writer instead
# of being written to InfluxDB. Rule configuration is the same as for the
# filter component, but the rule subject should be omitted.
[[rule]]
type = "basic"
match = "cgroup"
```

A writer will batch up messages until one of the limits defined by the
`batch_max_count`, `batch_max_size` or `batch_max_age` options is
reached.

The writer also supports optional HTTP basic authentication to the
InfluxDB backend. The username and password are set using the
`INFLUXDB_USER` and `INFLUXDB_PASS` environment variables. These
options can't be set via the configuration file.

### Monitor

The monitor is responsible for collecting metrics from the other
influx-spout components and serving then over HTTP in [Prometheus data
exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). Metrics
are available at `/metrics` on the configured port.

The supported configuration options for the monitor mode follow. Defaults are
shown.

```toml
mode = "monitor"  # Required

# Address of NATS server.
nats_address = "nats://localhost:4222"

# The NATS subject used by influx-spout components to report metrics to the monitor.
# The monitor will consume and aggregate metrics sent to this subject.
nats_subject_monitor = "influx-spout-monitor"

# The TCP port where the monitor will serve Prometheus formatted metrics over HTTP.
port = 9331

# The monitor will serve Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes on this port
# at /healthz and /readyz. Set to 0 (the default) to disable probes support.
probe_port = 0

# The monitor will serve Go pprof requests at this port. Set to 0 (the default)
# to disable pprof support.
pprof_port = 0
```


## Metrics

Each influx-spout component exposes internal metrics in [Prometheus
format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/). These
metrics can be retrieved using the HTTP endpoint exposed by the
monitor component.

The metrics published by each component are documented below. Each metric will have at least the following labels:

| Label     | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| component | The component type (e.g. "listener" or "writer") |
| name      | The configured name of component instance. This defaults to the configuration file name with the directory and extension stripped but can be overriden with the `name` option. |
| host      | The hostname on which the component is running |

Some metrics will include more labels which are documented below.

### Listener

| Metric              | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| received            | UDP packets received |
| sent                | Batches sent on for further processing |
| read_errors         | Failed UDP reads |
| failed_nats_publish | Failed attempts to publish to NATS |

### HTTP Listener

| Metric              | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| received            | Inbound HTTP requests handled |
| sent                | Batches sent on for further processing |
| read_errors         | Failures during HTTP request handling |
| failed_nats_publish | Failed attempts to publish to NATS |

### Filter

| Metric              | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| processed           | Input lines processed by the filter |
| passed              | Input lines that matched a filter rule |
| rejected            | Input lines which didn't match a filter rule |
| invalid_time        | Lines which were rejected because the timestamp was invalid or out of range |
| failed_nats_publish | Failed attempts to publish to NATS |
| nats_dropped        | Batches dropped by NATS because topic size limits were exceeded (filter too busy) |

In addition a `triggered` metric is published for each configured
rule. The value is a count of how many lines have matched this rule. A
`rule` label containing the output NATS subject is included with each
`triggered` metric.

### Downsampler

| Metric              | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| received            | Batches received by the downsampler |
| sent                | Batches sent by the downsampler (one per worker per sampling interval) |
| invalid_lines       | Lines rejected because they could not be parsed |
| invalid_timestamps  | Lines rejected because the timestamp was out of range |
| failed_nats_publish | Failed attempts to publish to NATS |

In addition, a `nats_droppped` metric will be published for each
configured input subject. This includes a `subject` label and is a
count of the batches dropped by NATS because topic size limits were
exceeded (downsampler too busy).

### Writer

As well as the standard labels, all writer metrics include the following labels:

| Label            | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| influxdb_address | The address of the InfluxDB endpoint being written to |
| influxdb_port    | The port of the InfluxDB endpoint being written to |
| influxdb_dbname  | The InfluxDB database name being written to |

A writer emits the following metrics:

| Metric              | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| received            | Batches received by the writer |
| write_requests      | Attempts to write to InfluxDB (including retries) |
| failed_writes       | Failed attempts to write to InfluxDB (including retries) |

In addition, a `nats_droppped` metric will be published for each
configured input subject. This includes a `subject` label and is a
count of the batches dropped by NATS because topic size limits were
exceeded (writer too busy).

### Monitor

The monitor component only aggregates metrics from other components
and does not currently publish its own metrics.


## Running tests

influx-spout's tests are classified as either "small", "medium" or "large",
where "small" tests are unit tests with no external dependencies and "large"
test are full system tests. To simplify running of tests a `runtests` helper is
provided.

Here's some example usage:

```
# Just run the small tests
$ ./runtests small

# Run the small & medium tests
$ ./runtests small medium

# Run the medium tests including benchmarks
$ ./runtests -b medium

# Run the small tests & generate coverage profiles
$ ./runtests -c medium

# Run the small tests with verbose output
$ ./runtests -v medium
```

## Checking for performance regressions

Benchmarks have been implemented for key areas of influx-spout's
functionality. The `perfcheck` script will compare the performance of these
benchmarks in the working tree against a fixed reference revision. Any
benchmarks that regress by 10% or more will be reported.

As for `runtests`, `perfcheck` takes the benchmark sizes to run:

```
# Just run the small benchmarks
$ ./perfcheck small

# Run the small & medium tests
$ ./perfcheck small medium
```

Here's an example of a detected performance regression:

```
$ ./perfcheck small

## Docker

To ease development or deployment to fancy infrastructure such as
[kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
is provided.


### Building a docker image

The [Makefile](Makefile) contains the magic to build the image easily:

    $ make docker

Check the version:

    $ docker images | grep influx-spout
    influx-spout                                      0.1.e6514f8          4af1ff8077d5        30 seconds ago      11.62 MB

To build images for a custom docker registry pass the `DOCKER_NAME` variable with the full name sans the tag:

    $ make docker DOCKER_NAME=quay.io/foo/influx-spout
    ... docker build output ...

    $ docker images | grep quay\.io
    quay.io/foo/influx-spout                          0.1.9adf7e6          94078aaba5f1        24 minutes ago      11.62 MB


### Setting up a test influx-spout instance using Docker

This requires running a nats container and an influx-spout container with
a shared network namespace. First things first, setup nats and expose
the ports for either of the example [http](example-http-listener.conf)
or [udp](example-udp-listener.conf) listener example configurations:

    $ docker run -p 11001:11001 -p 10001:10001 --rm -it --name nats-main nats
    [1] 2018/01/24 18:52:33.326930 [INF] Starting nats-server version 1.0.4
    [1] 2018/01/24 18:52:33.327212 [INF] Starting http monitor on 0.0.0.0:8222
    [1] 2018/01/24 18:52:33.327325 [INF] Listening for client connections on 0.0.0.0:4222
    [1] 2018/01/24 18:52:33.327391 [INF] Server is ready
    [1] 2018/01/24 18:52:33.328545 [INF] Listening for route connections on 0.0.0.0:6222

Next, run the influx-spout container, making sure to use the right
network namespace. It defaults to the http listener if no arguments are provided.

    $ docker run --network=container:nats-main -it influx-spout:0.1.e6514f8
    2018/01/24 19:23:03 Running /bin/influx-spout version e6514f8, built on 2018-01-24, go1.9.2
    2018/01/24 19:23:03 Listener bound to HTTP socket: :11001

An example UDP listener can be setup by specifying the full config path:

    $ docker run --network=container:nats-main -it influx-spout:0.1.e6514f8 /etc/influx-spout/udp-listener.toml
    2018/01/24 19:24:02 Running /bin/influx-spout version e6514f8, built on 2018-01-24, go1.9.2
    2018/01/24 19:24:02 Listener bound to UDP socket: 0.0.0.0:10001

Since the nats-main container is exporting both ports, they're ready to
accept traffic: The HTTP listener is easiest to test:

    $ curl -i -XPOST 'http://localhost:11001/write?db=mydb' --data-binary 'cpu_load_short,host=server01,region=us-west value=0.64 1434055562000000000'
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
